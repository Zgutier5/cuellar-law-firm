              Why should you choose an attorney over a bondsman? 
              Weâ€™re affordable, convenient, and will see the case through representation. 
              The goal is to make this a hassle-free process. You supply the information; the office will provide all the work. There are no co-signers required, which means you are not liable should the person not fulfill the conditions of his/her bond. Simply pay a one-time fee for the jail release.

              </p>
              <p className="profile-desc2 mb-3">
              We do not require collateral for the remainder of the bond amount. Do not wait! Unlike a bail bondsman, an attorney can waive magistration, allowing for a quicker processing time from jail. Retaining a jail release attorney gets your friend/loved one out of jail, as well as, begins the process of working on his/her defense. 
              </p>
              <p className="profile-desc2 mb-5">
              It is very important to retain an attorney as soon as possible to avoid unnecessary delays. I will work aggressively with the promise to work efficiently and as quickly as possible on the release of your friend or loved one.
